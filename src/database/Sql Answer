1、SELECT sname,ssex,Class FROM student;
2、SELECT DISTINCT depart FROM teacher;
3、SELECT * FROM student;
4、SELECT * FROM score WHERE degree >= 60 AND degree <= 80;
5、SELECT * FROM score WHERE degree IN(85,86,88);
6、SELECT * FROM student WHERE class = "95031" OR ssex = "女";
7、SELECT * FROM student ORDER BY class DESC;
8、SELECT * FROM score ORDER BY cno,degree DESC;
9、SELECT COUNT(sno) AS num_student FROM student WHERE class = "95031";
10、SELECT sno,cno FROM score WHERE degree = (SELECT DISTINCT degree FROM score ORDER BY degree DESC LIMIT 1);
扩充：SELECT sno,cno FROM score WHERE degree IN
     (SELECT * FROM (SELECT DISTINCT degree FROM score ORDER BY degree DESC LIMIT 3) AS foo) ORDER BY degree DESC;
11、SELECT AVG(degree) AS avg_degree FROM score WHERE cno = "3-105";
12、SELECT AVG(degree) AS avg_degree FROM score WHERE cno LIKE '3%' GROUP BY cno HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5;
13、
14、SELECT student.sname,score.cno,score.degree FROM student LEFT JOIN score ON student.sno = score.sno;
15、SELECT st.sno,c.cname,sc.degree FROM score sc RIGHT JOIN student st ON sc.sno = st.sno LEFT JOIN course c
    ON sc.cno = c.cno;
16、SELECT st.sname,c.cname,sc.degree FROM score sc RIGHT JOIN student st ON sc.sno = st.sno LEFT JOIN course c
    ON c.cno = sc.cno;
17、SELECT AVG(sc.degree) FROM student st JOIN score sc ON st.sno = sc.sno WHERE st.class = "95033";
18、
19、SELECT sno,degree FROM score WHERE degree > (SELECT degree FROM score WHERE sno = 109 and cno = "3-105")
    and cno = "3-105";
20、SELECT sno,COUNT(*) AS count_num FROM score WHERE degree < (SELECT MAX(degree) AS max_degree FROM score)
    GROUP BY sno HAVING count_num>1;    写的有点问题
21、SELECT sno,cno,degree FROM score WHERE degree > (SELECT degree FROM score WHERE sno = 109 and cno = "3-105");
22、
23、select sc.sno,sc.degree from score sc join course c on sc.cno = c.cno join teacher t on t.tno = c.tno
    where t.tname = "张旭";
24、SELECT t.tname FROM (SELECT cno,COUNT(cno) AS count_num FROM score GROUP BY cno HAVING count_num>5) AS foo
    JOIN course c ON foo.cno = c.cno JOIN teacher t ON c.tno = t.tno;
25、SELECT sno,sname FROM student WHERE class = "95033" OR class = "95031";
