1、SELECT sname,ssex,Class FROM student;
2、SELECT DISTINCT depart FROM teacher;
3、SELECT * FROM student;
4、SELECT * FROM score WHERE degree >= 60 AND degree <= 80;
5、SELECT * FROM score WHERE degree IN(85,86,88);
6、SELECT * FROM student WHERE class = "95031" OR ssex = "女";
7、SELECT * FROM student ORDER BY class DESC;
8、SELECT * FROM score ORDER BY cno,degree DESC;
9、SELECT COUNT(sno) AS num_student FROM student WHERE class = "95031";
10、SELECT sno,cno FROM score WHERE degree = (SELECT DISTINCT degree FROM score ORDER BY degree DESC LIMIT 1);
或者：SELECT sno,cno FROM score WHERE degree = (SELECT MAX(degree) AS max_degree FROM score);
扩充：SELECT sno,cno FROM score WHERE degree IN
     (SELECT * FROM (SELECT DISTINCT degree FROM score ORDER BY degree DESC LIMIT 3) AS foo) ORDER BY degree DESC;
11、SELECT AVG(degree) AS avg_degree FROM score WHERE cno = "3-105";
12、SELECT AVG(degree) AS avg_degree FROM score WHERE cno LIKE '3%' GROUP BY cno HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5;
13、SELECT sno FROM score GROUP BY sno HAVING MAX(degree) < 90 AND MIN(degree) > 70;
14、SELECT student.sname,score.cno,score.degree FROM student LEFT JOIN score ON student.sno = score.sno;
15、SELECT st.sno,c.cname,sc.degree FROM score sc RIGHT JOIN student st ON sc.sno = st.sno LEFT JOIN course c
    ON sc.cno = c.cno;
16、SELECT st.sname,c.cname,sc.degree FROM score sc RIGHT JOIN student st ON sc.sno = st.sno LEFT JOIN course c
    ON c.cno = sc.cno;
17、SELECT AVG(sc.degree) AS avg_degree FROM student st JOIN score sc ON st.sno = sc.sno WHERE st.class = "95033";
18、SELECT a.sno,a.cno,b.rank FROM score a,grade b WHERE a.degree BETWEEN b.low AND b.upp
    ORDER BY rank;
19、SELECT sno,degree FROM score WHERE degree > (SELECT degree FROM score WHERE sno = 109 and cno = "3-105")
    and cno = "3-105";
20、SELECT sno,COUNT(*) AS count_num FROM score WHERE degree < (SELECT MAX(degree) AS max_degree FROM score)
    GROUP BY sno HAVING count_num>1;    写的有点问题
21、SELECT sno,cno,degree FROM score WHERE degree > (SELECT degree FROM score WHERE sno = 109 and cno = "3-105");
22、SELECT sno,sname,sbirthday FROM student WHERE year(sbirthday) = (SELECT year(sbirthday) FROM student
    WHERE sno = 105) AND sno != 105;
23、SELECT sc.sno,sc.degree FROM score sc JOIN course c ON sc.cno = c.cno JOIN teacher t ON t.tno = c.tno
    WHERE t.tname = "张旭";
24、SELECT t.tname FROM (SELECT cno,COUNT(cno) AS count_num FROM score GROUP BY cno HAVING count_num>5) AS foo
    JOIN course c ON foo.cno = c.cno JOIN teacher t ON c.tno = t.tno;
25、SELECT sno,sname FROM student WHERE class = "95033" OR class = "95031";
26、SELECT DISTINCT cno FROM score WHERE degree > 85;
27、SELECT sno,degree FROM (SELECT tno FROM teacher t WHERE depart = "计算机系") AS foo JOIN course c ON foo.tno =
    c.tno JOIN score s ON c.cno = s.cno;
28、没明白题意
29、SELECT a.* FROM score a WHERE cno = "3-105" AND degree >= (SELECT degree FROM score b WHERE cno = "3-245"
    AND a.sno = b.sno) ORDER BY degree DESC;
30、SELECT a.* FROM score a WHERE cno = "3-105" AND degree > (SELECT degree FROM score b WHERE cno = "3-245"
    AND a.sno = b.sno);
31、SELECT sname name,ssex sex,sbirthday birthday FROM student UNION SELECT tname name,tsex sex,tbirthday birthday
    FROM teacher;
32、SELECT sname name,ssex sex,sbirthday birthday FROM student WHERE ssex = "女" UNION SELECT tname name,tsex sex,
    tbirthday birthday FROM teacher WHERE tsex = "女";
33、SELECT a.* FROM score a WHERE degree < (SELECT AVG(degree) FROM score b WHERE a.cno = b.cno);    没做出来
34、SELECT t.tname,t.depart FROM teacher t JOIN course c ON t.tno = c.tno;
35、SELECT tname,depart FROM teacher WHERE tname NOT IN (SELECT t.tname FROM teacher t JOIN course c ON t.tno = c.tno);
36、SELECT class,COUNT(*) AS count_num FROM student WHERE ssex = "男" GROUP BY class HAVING count_num >= 2;
37、SELECT * FROM student WHERE sname NOT LIKE "王%";
38、SELECT sname,year(from_days(datediff(now(),sbirthday))) AS age from student;
39、SELECT MAX(sbirthday) AS birthday FROM student UNION SELECT MIN(sbirthday) AS birthday FROM student
    ORDER BY birthday;
40、SELECT * FROM student ORDER BY class DESC,sbirthday;
41、SELECT t.tname,c.cname FROM teacher t LEFT JOIN course c ON t.tno = c.tno WHERE t.tsex = "男";
42、SELECT * FROM score WHERE degree = (SELECT MAX(degree) AS max_degree FROM score);
43、SELECT sname FROM student WHERE ssex = (SELECT ssex FROM student WHERE sname = "李军") AND sname != "李军";
44、SELECT sname FROM student WHERE ssex = (SELECT ssex FROM student WHERE sname = "李军")
    AND class = (SELECT class FROM student WHERE sname = "李军") AND sname != "李军";
45、SELECT st.sname,sc.degree FROM score sc JOIN student st ON sc.sno = st.sno JOIN course c
    ON c.cno = sc.cno WHERE c.cname = "计算机导论" AND st.ssex = "男";
